# BlazeProxy
BlazeProxy is a Minecraft Proxy that is Blaze-ingly fast (please laugh). It is written in Rust

## The state of the project
For now, the project is just a proof of concept. It hasn't much of functionnalities, except that it just redirects to a server.
In the future, I want the project to have these functionnalities:
- Redirect players to a network of server
- Have a basic and shared configuration, that each server will get.
- Be fast
